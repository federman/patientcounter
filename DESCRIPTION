Description: Fast, flexible census of patient occupancy in multiple locations in 
    hospital setting.  Obtain net count of patients, accounting for
    those admitted before and not yet discharged. 
    Typically, this requires a database / data warehouse and knowledge of 'SQL'. 
    This package allows anyone who has time in, time out, unique identifiers, 
    and an optional grouping variable, to accurately determine how many patients 
    were occupying beds, at any time of day and granularity.
